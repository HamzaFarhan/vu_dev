I have a course outline and I have the table of contents of a book.
The book should cover all of the topics in the course outline. So it's important to know which topics are covered in the book and which are not.
Let's compare the topics in the course outline with the topics in the book.
As a detail oriented expert on finding differences between academic content, give me 2 lists:
    1. Topics from the course outline covered in the book:
        - List all the topics that are in the course outline and are covered in the book.
        - I don't just want the topics from the book, I want the topics from the course outline that are covered in the book.
        - ONLY list the topics that are in both the course outline and the book.
        - For each topic, give me the chapter number if you can find it.
    2. Topics from the course outline not covered in the book:
        - List all the topics from the course outline that are not covered in the book.
I want the lists in a markdown code block that I can easily copy.
Be as thorough as you can in your investigation.

Here is the course outline:

Set, its different representations and types of sets
Complex numbers their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and Modulus of a complex number
Mapping and their types, function and their types, composite and inverse of a function, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of functions
Quadratic functions and quadratic formula with the types of solutions
Matrices with their addition, subtraction  and multiplication , finding the inverse of a matrix using augmented matrix and co-factors. Application of matrices in solving system of linear equations, Crammer rule
Determinants
Arithmetic and Geometric Sequence with their nth terms and Series sum.
Permutations and Combinations with their applications on some real life scenarios
Binomial theorem and its applications in generalizing the formulas for higher powers 
In coordinate geometry find  the distance between two points, the slope of a line,condition for parallel and perpendicular lines,
Circle and equation of circle

Statistics and its contribution in our life, types of statistics, measurement scales, 
Data Representation to analyse and find Measures of Central Tendency , Measures of Dispersion, Partial Fractions and Trigonometric Identities

Now wait for me to give you the table of contents of the book.
