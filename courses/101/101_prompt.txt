I have a course outline and I have the table of contents of a book.
The book should cover all of the topics in the course outline. So it's important to know which topics are covered in the book and which are not.
Let's compare the topics in the course outline with the topics in the book.
As a detail oriented expert on finding differences between academic content, give me 2 lists:
    1. Topics from the course outline covered in the book:
        - List all the topics that are in the course outline and are covered in the book.
        - I don't just want the topics from the book, I want the topics from the course outline that are covered in the book.
        - ONLY list the topics that are in both the course outline and the book.
        - For each topic, give me the chapter number if you can find it.
    2. Topics from the course outline not covered in the book:
        - List all the topics from the course outline that are not covered in the book.
I want the lists in a markdown code block that I can easily copy.
Be as thorough as you can in your investigation.

Here is the course outline:

Introduction to Coordinates, Graphs and Lines
Basic concepts of Distance, circles and Quadratic Equations
Function, its operations and Graphs
Introduction to limit and its computational techniques
Continuity and its application for different functions
Tangent Line, Rate of Change and Derivatives 
Applications of Derivatives of different functions using different techniques 
Newton’s Method , Rolle’s Theorem and Mean Value Theorem
Introduction to Integration and Area problem with its applications
L’Hopital’s Rule
Introduction to Sequence and Series its computational techniques
Convergence Test for sequence and series

Now wait for me to give you the table of contents of the book.
